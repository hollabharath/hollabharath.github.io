  abstract = {During the past decade, cognitive neuroscience has been calling for population diversity to address the challenge of validity and generalizability, ushering in  a new era of population neuroscience. The developing Chinese Color Nest Project  (devCCNP, 2013-2022), the first ten-year stage of the lifespan CCNP (2013-2032),  is a two-stages project focusing on brain-mind development. The project aims to  create and share a large-scale, longitudinal and multimodal dataset of typically  developing children and adolescents (ages 6.0-17.9 at enrolment) in the Chinese  population. The devCCNP houses not only phenotypes measured by demographic,  biophysical, psychological and behavioural, cognitive, affective, and  ocular-tracking assessments but also neurotypes measured with magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) of brain morphometry, resting-state function, naturalistic viewing  function and diffusion structure. This Data Descriptor introduces the first data  release of devCCNP including a total of 864 visits from 479 participants. Herein,  we provided details of the experimental design, sampling strategies, and  technical validation of the devCCNP resource. We demonstrate and discuss the  potential of a multicohort longitudinal design to depict normative brain growth  curves from the perspective of developmental population neuroscience. The devCCNP  resource is shared as part of the "Chinese Data-sharing Warehouse for In-vivo  Imaging Brain" in the Chinese Color Nest Project (CCNP) - Lifespan Brain-Mind  Development Data Community ( https://ccnp.scidb.cn ) at the Science Data Bank.},

  abstract = {The human gut microbiome regulates brain function through the microbiome-gut-brain axis and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric  disorders. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and the  pathogenesis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is poorly defined, and very few studies have  examined the effect of antipsychotic treatment response. We aim to study the  differences in the gut microbiota among drug-naïve (DN SCZ) and  risperidone-treated SCZ patients (RISP SCZ), compared to healthy controls (HCs).  We recruited a total of 60 participants, from the clinical services of a large  neuropsychiatric hospital, which included DN SCZ, RISP SCZ and HCs (n = 20 each).  Fecal samples were analyzed using 16s rRNA sequencing in this cross-sectional  study. No significant differences were found in taxa richness (alpha diversity)  but microbial composition differed between SCZ patients (both DN and RISP) and  HCs (PERMANOVA, p = 0.02). Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) and  Random Forest model identified the top six genera, which significantly differed  in abundance between the study groups. A specific genus-level microbial panel of  Ruminococcus, UCG005, Clostridium\_sensu\_stricto\_1 and Bifidobacterium could  discriminate SCZ patients from HCs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79,  HCs vs DN SCZ (AUC: 0.68), HCs vs RISP SCZ (AUC: 0.93) and DN SCZ vs RISP SCZ  (AUC: 0.87). Our study identified distinct microbial signatures that could aid in  the differentiation of DN SCZ, RISP SCZ, and HCs. Our findings contribute to a  better understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in SCZ pathophysiology and  suggest potential targeted interventions.},

  abstract = {Gender inequality across the world has been associated with a higher risk to mental health problems and lower academic achievement in women compared to men.  We also know that the brain is shaped by nurturing and adverse  socio-environmental experiences. Therefore, unequal exposure to harsher  conditions for women compared to men in gender-unequal countries might be  reflected in differences in their brain structure, and this could be the neural  mechanism partly explaining women's worse outcomes in gender-unequal countries.  We examined this through a random-effects meta-analysis on cortical thickness and  surface area differences between adult healthy men and women, including a  meta-regression in which country-level gender inequality acted as an explanatory  variable for the observed differences. A total of 139 samples from 29 different  countries, totaling 7,876 MRI scans, were included. Thickness of the right  hemisphere, and particularly the right caudal anterior cingulate, right medial  orbitofrontal, and left lateral occipital cortex, presented no differences or  even thicker regional cortices in women compared to men in gender-equal  countries, reversing to thinner cortices in countries with greater gender  inequality. These results point to the potentially hazardous effect of gender  inequality on women's brains and provide initial evidence for  neuroscience-informed policies for gender equality.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Arsenic, a contaminant of groundwater and irrigated crops, is a global public health hazard. Exposure to low levels of arsenic through food  extends well beyond the areas with high arsenic content in water. OBJECTIVE: To  identify cognitive impairments following commonly prevalent low-level arsenic  exposure and characterize their underlying brain mechanisms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter population-based cohort study analyzed  cross-sectional data of the Indian Consortium on Vulnerability to Externalizing  Disorders and Addictions (cVEDA) cohort, recruited between November 4, 2016, and  May 4, 2019. Participants aged 6 to 23 years were characterized using deep  phenotyping measures of behavior, neuropsychology, psychopathology, brain  neuroimaging, and exposure to developmental adversities and environmental  neurotoxins. All analyses were performed between June 1, 2020, and December 31,  2021. EXPOSURE: Arsenic levels were measured in urine as an index of exposure.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Executive function measured using the cVEDA  neuropsychological battery, gray matter volume (GMV) from T1-weighted magnetic  resonance imaging, and functional network connectivity measures from resting  state functional magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: A total of 1014  participants aged 6 to 23 years (589 male [58.1\%]; mean [SD] age, 14.86 [4.79]  years) were included from 5 geographic locations. Sparse-partial least squares  analysis was used to describe a negative association of arsenic exposure with  executive function (r = -0.12 [P = 5.4 × 10-4]), brain structure (r = -0.20  [P = 1.8 × 10-8]), and functional connectivity (within network, r = -0.12  [P = 7.5 × 10-4]; between network, r = -0.23 [P = 1.8 × 10-10]). Alterations in  executive function were partially mediated by GMV (b = -0.004 [95\% CI, -0.007 to  -0.002]) and within-network functional connectivity (b = -0.004 [95\% CI, -0.008  to -0.002]). Socioeconomic status and body mass index moderated the association  between arsenic and GMV, such that the association was strongest in participants  with lower socioeconomic status and body mass index. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that low-level arsenic  exposure was associated with alterations in executive functioning and underlying  brain correlates. These results indicate potential detrimental consequences of  arsenic exposure that are below the currently recommended guidelines and may  extend beyond endemic risk areas. Precision medicine approaches to study global  mental health vulnerabilities highlight widespread but potentially modifiable  risk factors and a mechanistic understanding of the impact of low-level arsenic  exposure on brain development.},

Clustering may be a useful approach to group multiple diverse  risks together and study their relation with psychopathology. To generate risk  clusters of children, adolescents, and young adults, based on adverse  environmental exposure and developmental characteristics, and to examine the  association of risk clusters with manifest psychopathology. Participants (n =  8300) between 6 and 23 years were recruited from seven sites in India. We  administered questionnaires to elicit history of previous exposure to adverse  childhood environments, family history of psychiatric disorders in first-degree  relatives, and a range of antenatal and postnatal adversities. We used these  variables to generate risk clusters. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric  Interview-5 was administered to evaluate manifest psychopathology. Two-step  cluster analysis revealed two clusters designated as high-risk cluster (HRC) and  low-risk cluster (LRC), comprising 4197 (50.5\%) and 4103 (49.5\%) participants,  respectively. HRC had higher frequencies of family history of mental illness,  antenatal and neonatal risk factors, developmental delays, history of migration,  and exposure to adverse childhood experiences than LRC. There were significantly  higher risks of any psychiatric disorder [Relative Risk (RR) = 2.0, 95\% CI  1.8-2.3], externalizing (RR = 4.8, 95\% CI 3.6-6.4) and internalizing disorders  (RR = 2.6, 95\% CI 2.2-2.9), and suicidality (2.3, 95\% CI 1.8-2.8) in HRC.  Social-environmental and developmental factors could classify Indian children,  adolescents and young adults into homogeneous clusters at high or low risk of  psychopathology. These biopsychosocial determinants of mental health may have  practice, policy and research implications for people in low- and middle-income  countries.},

Abilities, across executive, and social domains need better characterization over  development, including factors that influence developmental change. This study is  based on the cVEDA [Consortium on Vulnerability to Externalizing Disorders and  Addictions] study, an Indian population based developmental cohort. Verbal  working memory, visuo-spatial working memory, response inhibition, set-shifting,  and social cognition (faux pas recognition and emotion recognition) were  cross-sectionally assessed in {\textgreater} 8000 individuals over the ages 6-23 years. There  was adequate representation across sex, urban-rural background, psychosocial risk  (psychopathology, childhood adversity and wealth index, i.e. socio-economic  status). Quantile regression was used to model developmental change. Age-based  trajectories were generated, along with examination of the impact of determinants  (sex, childhood adversity, and wealth index). Development in both executive and  social cognitive abilities continued into adulthood. Maturation and stabilization  occurred in increasing order of complexity, from working memory to inhibitory  control to cognitive flexibility. Age related change was more pronounced for low  quantiles in response inhibition (β∼4 versus {\textless}/=2 for higher quantiles), but for  higher quantiles in set-shifting (β {\textgreater} -1 versus -0.25 for lower quantiles).  Wealth index had the largest influence on developmental change across cognitive  abilities. Sex differences were prominent in response inhibition, set-shifting  and emotion recognition. Childhood adversity had a negative influence on  cognitive development. These findings add to the limited literature on patterns  and determinants of cognitive development. They have implications for  understanding developmental vulnerabilities in young persons, and the need for  providing conducive socio-economic environments.},

Decentralized exploratory analysis of  nearly 2000 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets  collected at different sites across two cohorts and co-located in different  countries was performed to study the resting brain functional network  connectivity changes in adolescents who smoke and consume alcohol. Results showed  hypoconnectivity across the majority of networks including sensory, default mode,  and subcortical domains, more for alcohol than smoking, and decreased low  frequency power. These findings suggest that global reduced synchronization is  associated with both tobacco and alcohol use.

This cross-sectional study aimed to  understand the differences in the expression of gunas in patients suffering from  major psychiatric disorders (n = 113, 40 females) and  age-gender-education-matched healthy controls (HCs; n = 113, 40 females).  Patients were diagnosed by a psychiatrist using DSM 5 criteria and suffered from  the following disorders: depression (n = 30), schizophrenia (SCZ; n = 28),  obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 23), anxiety (n = 16), and bipolar  affective disorder (BPAD; n = 16). Tri-gunas were assessed using a validated tool  (Vedic Personality Inventory) and symptoms were assessed using standard scales as  per the diagnosis. Multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess  the differences in guna scores between HCs and patients, and between patients  with different diagnoses. A two-tailed Pearson correlation was performed between  the gunas and psychometric scales. Results revealed that HCs had significantly  higher sattva traits as compared to patients (except those with OCD). Each  psychiatric diagnosis also showed a specific guna configuration: (1) Anxiety  disorders and OCD: High sattva-rajas, low tamas; (2) Depression: High  sattva-tamas, low rajas; (3) Psychotic disorders (SCZ/BPAD): High tamo-rajas, low  sattva. Significant positive correlations were observed between rajas traits and  anxiety/OC/positive psychotic symptoms, negative psychotic symptoms and tamas  traits, and sattva traits and OC symptoms. This finding has clinical  implications, both to develop ways of predicting outcomes of psychiatric  disorders, as well as to develop psycho-therapeutic and lifestyle interventions  targeting the gunas.},

Unaffected FDRs from multiplex families with severe mental  illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or  alcohol use disorder) (n = 324) and healthy controls (with no familial risk)  (n = 188) underwent neurocognitive tests for processing speed, new learning,  working memory and Theory of Mind. ACEs were measured using the WHO  ACE-International Questionnaire (ACE-IQ). Regression models were done to predict  each neurocognitive domain by the effect of familial risk, ACE-IQ Score and their  interaction (familial risk*ACE-IQ score). The main effect of familial risk  predicted poor performance in all domains of neurocognition (p {\textless} 0.01), and the  interaction had a negative association with global neurocognition (β = -0.093,  p = 0.009), processing speed (β = -0.109, p = 0.003) and working memory  (β = -0.092, p = 0.01). Among the ACEs sub-domains, only maltreatment  (specifically the main effect of physical neglect and the interaction effect of  sexual abuse with familial risk) predicted poorer neurocognition. In FDRs of  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, only the main effects of familial risk were  significantly associated with poorer neurocognition. We conclude that there is a  relationship between ACEs (especially maltreatment) and neurocognitive  functioning, which is moderated by the familial risk of mental illnesses.  Genetic/familial vulnerability may have a stronger association with  neurocognition in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.},

Genes that are central to the  shared biology of SMIs may be identified by WES in families with multiple  affected individuals with diverse SMI (F-SMI). We performed WES in 220  individuals from 75 F-SMI families and 60 unrelated controls. Within pedigree  prioritization employed criteria of rarity, functional consequence, and sharing  by ≥ 3 affected members. Across the sample, gene and gene-set-wide case-control  association analysis was performed with Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT).  In 14/16 families with ≥ 3 sequenced affected individuals, we identified a total  of 78 rare predicted deleterious variants in 78 unique genes shared by ≥ 3  members with SMI. Twenty (25\%) genes were implicated in monogenic CNS syndromes  in OMIM (OMIM-CNS), a fraction that is a significant overrepresentation (Fisher's  Exact test OR = 2.47, p = 0.001). In gene-set SKAT, statistically significant  association was noted for OMIM-CNS gene-set (SKAT-p = 0.005) but not the synaptic  gene-set (SKAT-p = 0.17). In this WES study in F-SMI, we identify private, rare,  protein altering variants in genes previously implicated in Mendelian  neuropsychiatric syndromes; suggesting pleiotropic influences in neurodevelopment  between complex and Mendelian syndromes.},

Harmonization methods attempt to correct these site effects  while preserving the biological variability within the features.

In this study, we performed experiments to find the minimum sample size  required to achieve multisite harmonization (using neuroHarmonize) using  volumetric and surface features by leveraging the concept of learning curves. Our  first two experiments show that site-effects are effectively removed in a  univariate and multivariate manner; however, it is essential to regress the  effect of covariates from the harmonized data additionally. Our following two  experiments with actual and simulated data showed that the minimum sample size  required for achieving harmonization grows with the increasing average  Mahalanobis distances between the sites and their reference distribution. We  conclude by positing a general framework to understand the site effects using the  Mahalanobis distance. Further, we provide insights on the various factors in a  cross-validation design to achieve optimal inter-site harmonization.},

However, the  etiological and clinical relationships between the two disorders remain unclear.  We compared the clinical characteristics and pharmacological treatment response  in patients diagnosed with OCD with a family history of psychosis (OCD-FHP), with  a family history of OCD (OCD-FHO) and those with sporadic OCD (OCD-S). METHODS: A  total of 226 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for OCD (OCD-FHP = 59,  OCD-FHO = 112, OCD-S = 55) were included for analysis. All patients were  evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0.0),  Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and the Family Interview for  Genetic Studies (FIGS). Treatment response was characterized over naturalistic  follow-up. RESULTS: The three groups did not differ across any demographic or  clinical variables other than treatment response. Patients in the OCD-FHP group  were found to have received a greater number of trials with serotonin reuptake  inhibitors (SRI) [F (2,223) = 7.99, p {\textless} 0.001], were more likely to have failed  ≥2 trials of SRIs (χ(2) = 8.45, p = 0.014), and less likely to have attained  remission (χ(2) = 6.57, p = 0.037) CONCLUSIONS: We observed that having a  relative with psychosis may predispose to treatment resistance in OCD. Further  research on the influence of genetic liability to psychosis on treatment response  in OCD may offer novel translational leads.},

METHODS: Following stratified proportionate  random sampling, selected doctors in the south zone of Bengaluru, India, were  interviewed face-to-face using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 150 doctors  were interviewed. In their practice, a quarter of patients (median of 27.5 (IQR:  11.45-45) use one or other form of Alcohol, Tobacco or Other Drugs of abuse  (ATOD). Doctors, in general, enquire about substance use but do not actively  intervene. They have mixed attitudes (both positive and negative) towards persons  with SUD. A significant positive correlation was noted between the number of  years of experience (post-MBBS) with practices related to "brief-intervention"  (p = 0.014) and "concerned and sympathetic" attitudes (p {\textless} 0.001). However, a  significant negative correlation was observed between the number of years of  experience and "substance-specific management" practices (p {\textless} 0.001). Further,  there was a positive correlation between "brief-interventions" practices with the  attitude of being "concerned and sympathetic" (p {\textless} 0.001). A mediation analysis  revealed that nearly a third of the overall effect of the number of years of  experience on brief-interventions practices was mediated by a concerned and  sympathetic attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Serious efforts must be made to train doctors  in the effective management of SUD. Attitudes of the doctors influence practices  such as brief interventions. Programs directed towards changing the attitudes of  doctors can bring changes in their practices.},

We studied the migration patterns of induced pluripotent stem  cell-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) from individuals with familial bipolar  disorder (BD) in comparison with healthy controls. The BD patients also had  morphological brain abnormalities evident on magnetic resonance imaging.  Time-lapse analysis of migrating cells was performed, through which we were able  to identify several parameters that were abnormal in cellular migration,  including the speed and directionality of NPCs. We also performed transcriptomic  analysis to probe the mechanisms behind the aberrant cellular phenotype  identified. Our analysis showed the downregulation of a network of genes,  centering on EGF/ERBB proteins. The present findings indicate that collective,  systemic dysregulation may produce the aberrant cellular phenotype, which could  contribute to the functional and structural changes in the brain reported for  bipolar disorder.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence and increasing interest for systemic integration of medicine (synergistic and evidence-based combination of different  systems along with conventional biomedicine). The National Institute of Mental  Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), an Institute of National Importance and a  tertiary mental and neurological healthcare hospital situated in Bengaluru,  India, has established one such integrative model. The present manuscript traces  the history and describes the important steps followed in this integrative  approach. METHODOLOGY: The NIMHANS model followed a stage-wise two-step approach:  (1) First stage - Starting with Integration of Yoga: The process began more than  a decade ago, with integrating yoga into a clinical department (rather than an  exclusive research-based approach) of the institute which had relatively high  clinical service load (For example, Department of Psychiatry in NIMHANS). Yoga  was gradually formalized into academic and clinical activities (outpatient and  inpatient services) by appointing a Yoga faculty with a medical background with  an MD/PhD in Yoga. The research was primarily directed by the clinical  observations of patients receiving yoga therapy. (2) Second stage: Adding an  appropriate and compatible discipline from Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani,  Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) system (Ayurveda in this case): The center for  yoga gradually evolved into the Department of Integrative Medicine with the  appointment of faculty from the Ayurveda stream. In this model, specialists from  each discipline provide clinical inputs after simultaneous consultation with the  patient through systemic integration in clinical, academic, and research domains  rather than mere co-location of AYUSH services with mainstream medicine.  CONCLUSION: The NIMHANS model of integration suggests the application of yoga  into mainstream clinical service as the first step toward integration. Yoga  should be added as a formalized clinical discipline with systemic integration.  Gradually, other feasible systems of traditional medicine from AYUSH can be  integrated at a later stage in a step-by-step manner based on clinical practice  and evidence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Facial features can be potentially reconstructed from structural magnetic resonance images, thereby compromising the confidentiality of  study participants. Defacing methods can be applied to MRI images to ensure  privacy of study participants. These methods remove facial features, thereby  rendering the image unidentifiable. It is commonly assumed that defacing would  not have any impact on quantitative assessments of the brain. In this study, we  have assessed the impact of different defacing methods on quality and volumetric  estimates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed SPM-, Freesurfer-, pydeface, and  FSL-based defacing on 30 T1-weighted images. We statistically compared the change  in quality measurements (from MRIQC) and volumes (from SPM, CAT, and Freesurfer)  between non-defaced and defaced images. We also calculated the Dice coefficient  of each tissue class between non-defaced and defaced images. RESULTS: Almost all  quality measurements and tissue volumes changed after defacing, irrespective of  the method used. All tissue volumes decreased post-defacing for CAT, but no such  consistent trend was seen for SPM and Freesurfer. Dice coefficients indicated  that segmentations are relatively robust; however, partial volumes might be  affected leading to changed volumetric estimates. CONCLUSION: In this study, we  demonstrated that volumes and quality measurements get affected differently by  defacing methods. It is likely that this will have a significant impact on the  reproducibility of experiments. We provide suggestions on ways to minimize the  impact of defacing on outcome measurements. Our results warrant the need for  robust handling of defaced images at different steps of image processing.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Emerging studies have shown that gut-derived endotoxins might play a role in intestinal and systemic inflammation. Although the  significance of intestinal permeability in modulating the pathogenesis of  Schizophrenia (SCZ) is recognized, not much data on the specific role of  intestinal permeability biomarkers, viz., zonulin, lipopolysaccharide-binding  protein (LBP), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) in SCZ is available.  Therefore, we measured the plasma levels of zonulin, LBP, and IAP and its  correlation with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR); a marker of systemic  inflammation in patients with SCZ. METHODS: We recruited 60 individuals, patients  with SCZ (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 20), from a large tertiary  neuropsychiatry center. Plasma levels of zonulin, IAP, and LBP were quantified by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Plasma levels of both LBP and zonulin  were significantly increased (P {\textless}0.05), whereas the IAP levels (P {\textless}0.05) were  significantly decreased in patients with SCZ compared to healthy controls.  Pearson correlation analysis revealed that zonulin and LBP had a significant  positive correlation with NLR, and IAP negatively correlated with NLR.  Individuals with SCZ had higher independent odds of zonulin [odds ratio (OR):  10.32, 95\% CI: 1.85-57.12], LBP [OR: 1.039, 95\% CI: 1.02-1.07], and IAP [OR:  0.643, 95\% CI: 0.471-0.879], even after adjusting for potential confounders.  CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates an association of zonulin, LBP, and IAP in  Asian Indian SCZ patients and correlates with NLR. Our results indicate that  low-grade inflammation induced by metabolic endotoxemia might be implicated in  the pathoetiology of SCZ.},

  abstract = {Over the past few decades, neuroimaging has become a ubiquitous tool in basic research and clinical studies of the human brain. However, no reference standards  currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over  time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and  weight(1). Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain  morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data (  http://www.brainchart.io/ ). With the goal of basing these reference charts on  the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due  to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global  population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary  studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100  years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to  non-linear trajectories(2) of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over  the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental  milestones(3), showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal  assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological  differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability  compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of  atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation  across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an  essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked  to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Ayurveda and Siddha are two important components of the traditional Indian medicine (TIM). The regulatory mechanisms have been insufficient, and  heavy metal toxicity with TIM preparations continues to be a public health  nuisance, putting integrated medicine practice in jeopardy. The current study was  undertaken to review the potential health hazards of the heavy metal content in  the TIM and formulate patient-safety recommendations for integrative medical  practice. Materials and Methods: Systematic MEDLINE searches were performed using  a combination of relevant MeSH terms and keywords, and case report/series of  Ayurveda or Siddha-induced heavy metal toxicity, published in the previous two  decades, were included. Risk of bias was assessed with the tool by Murad et al.  Results: A total of 220 cases (51 case reports and 14 case series) were found  (lead, n = 156; arsenic, n = 11; mercury, n = 47; thallium, n = 1; gold, n = 1;  combination of heavy metals, n = 4) after screening for the inclusion and  exclusion criteria. Among them, 169 (76.8\%) had a low risk of bias, 113 (out of  135 [83.7\%] analyzed) contained higher-than-permissible heavy metal content in  the drug samples, and the majority showed elevated biological levels of the heavy  metals in the body. Conclusion: The heavy metals in TIM are often the result of  adulteration or improper manufacturing and prescribing practices, despite  national and international guidelines recommending quality standards and  protocols for preparing and dispensing TIM. We thus propose multipronged  approaches and provide recommendations at various levels, including individual,  institutional, national policy decisions essential to establish patient safety of  TIM.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary trends may underlie some aspects of the risk for common, non-communicable disorders, including psychiatric disease. We analyzed whole  exome sequencing data from 80 unique individuals from India coming from families  with two or more individuals with severe mental illness. We used Population  Branch Statistics (PBS) to identify variants and genes under positive selection  and identified 74 genes as candidates for positive selection. Of these, 20 were  previously associated with Schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and cognitive  abilities in genome wide association studies. We then checked whether any of  these 74 genes were involved in common biological pathways or related to specific  cellular or molecular functions. We found that immune related pathways and  functions related to innate immunity such as antigen binding were  over-represented. We also evaluated for the presence of Neanderthal introgressed  segments in these genes and found Neanderthal introgression in a single gene out  of the 74 candidate genes. However, the introgression pattern indicates the  region is unlikely to be the source for selection. Our findings hint at how  selection pressures in individuals from families with a history of severe mental  illness may diverge from the general population. Further, it also provides  insights into the genetic architecture of severe mental illness, such as  schizophrenia and its link to immune factors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increases vulnerability to externalising disorders such as substance misuse. The study aims to determine the  prevalence of ACEs and its association with substance misuse. METHODS: Data from  the Consortium on Vulnerability to Externalising Disorders and Addictions (cVEDA)  in India was used (n = 9010). ACEs were evaluated using the World Health  Organisation (WHO) Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaire  whilst substance misuse was assessed using the WHO Alcohol, Smoking and Substance  Involvement Screening Test. A random-effects, two-stage individual patient data  meta-analysis explained the associations between ACEs and substance misuse with  adjustments for confounders such as sex and family structure. RESULTS: 1 in 2  participants reported child maltreatment ACEs and family level ACEs. Except for  sexual abuse, males report more of every individual childhood adversity and are  more likely to report misusing substances compared with females (87.3\% vs.  12.7\%). In adolescents, family level ACEs (adj OR 4.2, 95\% CI 1.5-11.7) and  collective level ACEs (adj OR 6.6, 95\% CI 1.4-31.1) show associations with  substance misuse whilst in young adults, child level ACEs such as maltreatment  show similar strong associations (adj OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1-3.5). CONCLUSION: ACEs  such as abuse and domestic violence are strongly associated with substance  misuse, most commonly tobacco, in adolescent and young adult males in India. The  results suggest enhancing current ACE resilience programmes and 'trauma-informed'  approaches to tackling longer-term impact of ACEs in India.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Minor physical anomalies (MPA) are markers of impaired neurodevelopment during the prenatal stage. Assessing MPA across psychiatric  disorders may help understand their shared nature. In addition, MPA in family  members would indicate a shared liability and endophenotype potential. We  examined familial aggregation of MPA and their role as transdiagnostic and  disorder-specific markers of 5 major psychiatric/neuropsychiatric conditions  (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, substance dependence, obsessive-compulsive  disorder, and Alzheimer's dementia). METHODS: Modified Waldrop's MPA scale was  applied on 1321 individuals from 439 transdiagnostic multiplex families and 125  healthy population controls (HC). Stage of fetal development  (morphogenetic/phenogenetic)- and anatomical location  (craniofacial/peripheral)-based sub-scores were calculated. Familiality and  endophenotypic potential of MPA were analyzed with serial negative binomial  mixed-effect regression. Cross-diagnostic differences and the effect of family  history density (FHD) of each diagnosis on MPA were assessed. Mixed-effects Cox  models estimated the influence of MPA on age-at-onset of illness (AAO). RESULTS:  MPA were found to be heritable in families with psychiatric disorders, with a  familiality of 0.52. MPA were higher in psychotic disorders after controlling for  effects of sex and intrafamilial correlation. Morphogenetic variant MPA was noted  to be lower in dementia in comparison to HC. FHD of schizophrenia and bipolar  disorder predicted higher, and that of dementia and substance dependence  predicted lower MPA. MPA brought forward the AAO [HR:1.07 (1.03-1.11)], and this  was more apparent in psychotic disorders. CONCLUSION: MPA are transmissible in  families, are specifically related to the risk of developing psychoses, and  predict an earlier age at onset. Neurodevelopmentally informed classification of  MPA has the potential to enhance the etiopathogenic and translational  understanding of psychiatric disorders.},

One such open-source framework is the Collaborative  Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC)  that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and leverages  containerized analysis pipelines to analyze neuroimaging data stored locally  across multiple physical locations without the need for pooling the data at any  point during the analysis. In this paper, the COINSTAC team partnered with a data  collection consortium to implement the first-ever decentralized voxelwise  analysis of brain imaging data performed outside the COINSTAC development group.  Decentralized voxel-based morphometry analysis of over 2000 structural magnetic  resonance imaging data sets collected at 14 different sites across two cohorts  and co-located in different countries was performed to study the structural  changes in brain gray matter which linked to age, body mass index (BMI), and  smoking. Results produced by the decentralized analysis were consistent with and  extended previous findings in the literature. In particular, a widespread  cortical gray matter reduction (resembling a 'default mode network' pattern) and  hippocampal increase with age, bilateral increases in the hypothalamus and basal  ganglia with BMI, and cingulate and thalamic decreases with smoking. This work  provides a critical real-world test of the COINSTAC framework in a "Large-N"  study. It showcases the potential benefits of performing multivoxel and  multivariate analyses of large-scale neuroimaging data located at multiple sites.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Craving is the subjective experience of desire for specific drugs. Lack of reliability and untested construct validity are limiting factors for the  existing questionnaires to assess craving. AIM: The aim of the study was to  design and test the validity and reliability of an instrument to assess visual  cue-induced craving for heroin dependence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first  stage of the study, a set of forty images (twenty each of heroin and neutral  cues-) were captured and validated by expert consensus. Thirty male participants  with heroin dependence rated their cue-induced craving on a six-point Likert  scale while viewing this image-set. In the next stage, putative construct  validity was examined using a pilot cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance  imaging paradigm with ten additional heroin-dependent patients. RESULTS:  Cronbach's alpha for the instrument for visual cue-associated craving of HEroin  (IV-CACHE) was 0.9, suggestive of high internal consistency. There were modest  and significant correlations of IV-CACHE with the drug desire questionnaire (r =  0.43), and obsessive-compulsive drug use scale (r = 0.37), supporting concurrent  validity. Patients with heroin dependence exhibited cue reactivity in the left  fusiform area, right lingual gyrus, right precuneus region, right inferior  frontal, inferior temporal gyri, and middle occipital gyri. The activated brain  areas were largely aligned to the underlying neurobiological substrates of  craving but might also have depicted nondrug-specific factors (aberrant face  processing and attentional bias). CONCLUSION: The present cue-task is a promising  tool for the examination of cue-related craving for heroin in the Indian setting.},

We describe the ADBS protocols for  acquisition, quality assurance (QA), and quality check (QC) for multimodal  magnetic resonance brain imaging studies. METHODS: We describe the acquisition  and QC protocols for structural, functional, and diffusion images. For QA, we  acquire proton density and functional images on phantoms, along with repeated  scans on human volunteer. We describe the analysis of phantom data and  test-retest reliability of volumetric and diffusion measures. RESULTS: Analysis  of acquired phantom data shows linearity of proton density signal with increasing  proton fraction, and an overall stability of various spatial and temporal QA  measures. Examination of dice coefficient and statistical analyses of coefficient  of variation in test-retest data on the human volunteer showed consistency of  volumetric and diffusivity measures at whole-brain, regional, and voxel-level.  CONCLUSION: The described acquisition and QA-QC procedures can yield consistent  and reliable quantitative measures. It is expected that this longitudinal  neuroimaging dataset will, upon its release, serve the scientific community well  and pave the way for interesting discoveries.},

The aims of  this review are to provide a prevalence of child maltreatment in India with  considerations for any effects of gender; urbanisation (eg, urban vs rural) and  legislation (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012).  METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A rapid review will be undertaken of all quantitative  peer-reviewed studies on child maltreatment in India between 2005 and 2020. Four  electronic databases will be systematically searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane  and PsychInfo. The primary outcomes will include all aspects of child  maltreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, emotional neglect  and physical neglect. Study participants will be between 0 and 18 years and will  have reported maltreatment experiences using validated, reliable tools such as  the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire as well as child self-reports and  clinician reports. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for  Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, and the methodological appraisal  of the studies will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality assessment scale.  A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. Also, if  sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Effect sizes  will be determined from random-effects models stratified by gender, urbanisation  and the pre-2012 and post-2012 POCSO Act cut-off. I(2) statistics will be used to  assess heterogeneity and identify their potential sources and τ(2) statistics  will indicate any between-study variance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As this is a  rapid review, minimal ethical risks are expected. The protocol and level 1  self-audit checklist were submitted and approved by the Usher Research Ethics  Group panel in the Usher Institute (School of Medicine and Veterinary Sciences)  at the University of Edinburgh (Reference B126255). Findings from this review  will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and in various  media, for example, conferences, congresses or symposia.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study  was to characterize clinical and neuropsychological profiles and to identify the  probable neural substrate for this phenomenon in major cognitive disorder.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study from February 2015 to May  2017 in patients with Major Cognitive Disorder (MCD, DSM-5 criteria). All  patients were tested for problems in reflected image processing using the  detailed protocol after ethical approval of the institute and consent. They also  underwent a detailed neuropsychological evaluation, biochemical tests and  neuroimaging (structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI) as per  established protocol. RESULTS: Of the 18 patients, 11 had mirror agnosia (MA), 5  had mirror image agnosia (MIA) and 2 had both. MRI of MA patients showed parietal  atrophy and whereas diffuse pattern of atrophy was seen with MIA. In the MA  group, the left superior longitudinal fasciculus showed significantly greater  fractional anisotropy and the left angular gyrus showed increased functional  connectivity with left anterior cingulate, left dorsolateral prefrontal and  bilateral posterior cingulate regions. CONCLUSION: Mirror image processing  defects were not related to the type of MCD, severity or pattern of  neuropsychological dysfunction. There are structural and functional alterations  in localized regions as well as both hemispheres. Therefore, it is more likely to  be a network disorder, irrespective of the MCD type or severity.},

  abstract = {Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous illness, and emerging evidence suggests that different symptom dimensions may have distinct  underlying neurobiological mechanisms. We aimed to look for familial patterns in  the occurrence of these symptom dimensions in a sample of families with at least  two individuals affected with OCD. Methods: Data from 153 families (total number  of individuals diagnosed with DSM-5 OCD = 330) recruited as part of the  Accelerator Program for Discovery in Brain Disorders using Stem Cells (ADBS) was  used for the current analysis. Multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) was  used to extract dimensional scores from the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale  (YBOCS) checklist data. Using linear mixed-effects regression models, intra-class  correlation coefficients (ICC), for each symptom dimension, and within each  relationship type were estimated. Results: IRT yielded a four-factor solution  with Factor 1 (Sexual/Religious/Aggressive), Factor 2 (Doubts/Checking), Factor 3  (Symmetry/Arranging), and Factor 4 (Contamination/Washing). All except for Factor  1 were found to have significant ICCs, highest for Factor 3 (0.41) followed by  Factor 4 (0.29) and then Factor 2 (0.27). Sex-concordant dyads were found to have  higher ICC values than discordant ones, for all the symptom dimensions. No major  differences in the ICC values between parent-offspring and sib-pairs were seen.  Conclusions: Our findings indicate that there is a high concordance of OCD  symptom dimensions within multiplex families. Symptom dimensions of OCD might  thus have significant heritability. In view of this, future genetic and  neurobiological studies in OCD should include symptom dimensions as a key  parameter in their analyses.},

  abstract = {A history of psychiatric illnesses in family members of those diagnosed to have an illness has been of significant interest both in research and in clinical  practice. Almost all of the major psychiatric illnesses have a familial component  to them, perhaps influenced by genetics and a shared environment or their  combination. Systematic attempts have been made to quantify these familial risks,  as obtained from family history (FH) of psychiatric illnesses. The methods range  from a simple dichotomous or count scores to those quantifying as weighted risks  such as the Family history density (FHD) measures. This article reviews the  available literature on such FH methods and discusses their advantages and  limitations. Validation studies have shown that FHD measures may be preferred  over dichotomous measures as indicators of familial risk. However, the FHD method  has certain limitations, like mostly relying on categorical diagnosis and  ignoring other familial risk factors. By critically analysing various existing  density measures based on 'ideal characteristics', we suggest a modified version  of FHD that would benefit psychiatric research.},

We screened 3583 families to  identify 481 families with multiple affected members, assessed 1406 individuals  in person, and collected information systematically about other relatives. Within  the selected families, a third of all FDRs were affected with serious mental  illness. Although similar diagnoses aggregated within families, 62\% of the  families also had members with other syndromes. Moreover, 15\% of affected  individuals met criteria for co-occurrence of two or more syndromes, across their  lifetime. Using dimensional assessments, we detected a range of symptom clusters  in both affected and unaffected individuals, and across diagnostic categories.  Our findings suggest that in multiplex families, there is considerable  heterogeneity of clinical syndromes, as well as sub-threshold symptoms.

  abstract = {Anatomical brain templates are commonly used as references in neurological MRI studies, for bringing data into a common space for group-level statistics and  coordinate reporting. Given the inherent variability in brain morphology across  age and geography, it is important to have templates that are as representative  as possible for both age and population. A representative-template increases the  accuracy of alignment, decreases distortions as well as potential biases in final  coordinate reports. In this study, we developed and validated a new set of T1w  Indian brain templates (IBT) from a large number of brain scans (total n = 466)  acquired across different locations and multiple 3T MRI scanners in India. A new  tool in AFNI, make\_template\_dask.py, was created to efficiently make five  age-specific IBTs (ages 6-60 years) as well as maximum probability map (MPM)  atlases for each template; for each age-group's template-atlas pair, there is  both a "population-average" and a "typical" version. Validation experiments on an  independent Indian structural and functional-MRI dataset show the appropriateness  of IBTs for spatial normalization of Indian brains. The results indicate  significant structural differences when comparing the IBTs and MNI template, with  these differences being maximal along the Anterior-Posterior and  Inferior-Superior axes, but minimal Left-Right. For each age-group, the MPM brain  atlases provide reasonably good representation of the native-space volumes in the  IBT space, except in a few regions with high intersubject variability. These  findings provide evidence to support the use of age and population-specific  templates in human brain mapping studies.},

Our study examined the pattern of  adverse childhood experiences and their relation to the age of onset of major  psychiatric conditions in individuals from families that had ⩾2 first-degree  relatives with major psychiatric conditions (multiplex families), identified as  part of an ongoing longitudinal study. METHODS: Our sample consisted of 509  individuals from 215 families. Of these, 268 were affected, i.e., diagnosed with  bipolar disorder (n = 61), obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 58), schizophrenia  (n = 52), substance dependence (n = 59) or co-occurring diagnoses (n = 38), while  241 were at-risk first-degree relatives who were either unaffected (n = 210) or  had other depressive or anxiety disorders (n = 31). All individuals were  evaluated using the Adverse Childhood Experiences - International Questionnaire  and total adverse childhood experiences exposure and severity scores were  calculated. RESULTS: It was seen that affected males, as a group, had the  greatest adverse childhood experiences exposure and severity scores in our  sample. A Cox mixed effects model fit by gender revealed that a higher total  adverse childhood experiences severity score was associated with significantly  increased risk for an earlier age of onset of psychiatric diagnoses in males. A  similar model that evaluated the interaction of diagnosis revealed an earlier age  of onset in obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance dependence, but not in  schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that adverse  childhood experiences were associated with an earlier onset of major psychiatric  conditions in men and individuals diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder  and substance dependence. Ongoing longitudinal assessments in first-degree  relatives from these families are expected to identify mechanisms underlying this  relationship.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a promising new adjuvant approach in the treatment of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) that has the  potential to ameliorate the aberrations secondary to chronic alcohol use. In this  study, using a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, parallel-arm design, we  examined the effects of prefrontal tDCS on resting-state functional magnetic  resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and its correlates with impulsivity and time to first  lapse in subjects with AUDs. METHODS: Patients with AUD as per DSM-5 criteria  were randomly allocated to receive a five-day course of either verum-tDCS  (n = 12) or sham-tDCS (n = 12). Of them, 21 patients (verum/sham = 11/10)  participated in both baseline and post-intervention 10-min rsfMRI sessions.  Outside the scanner, subjects also performed the Stop-Signal Task at two  time-points (baseline and post-intervention), which provided a measure of changes  in impulsivity following tDCS. After completion of the post-intervention scan,  all subjects were discharged and were followed-up for 90 days post-discharge or  until lapse to first alcohol use. RESULTS: Graph theoretical analysis of rsfMRI  data revealed that verum-tDCS (but not sham) resulted in a significant increase  in the global efficiency of brain networks with a concurrent significant  reduction in global clustering; network-based statistical analysis identified a  significant increase in the functional connectivity of a specific sub-network  involving prefrontal regions. Furthermore, increased global efficiency of brain  networks following verum tDCS predicted a significantly reduced likelihood of  relapse. In addition, a reduction in the global clustering had a significant  positive correlation with a reduction in the measure of impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS:  The present study adds further support to the increasing evidence base for the  clinical utility of tDCS in AUDs. Importantly, we observed improvement in both  whole-brain network efficiency as well as inter-regional connectivity within a  specific local prefrontal sub-network that is relevant to the neurobiology of  AUDs. Replication and extension of these promising leads from the present study  can facilitate clinical translation of tDCS, given its advantages (i.e. safety,  cost-effectiveness, administration ease with potential for remotely-supervised /  home-based application) for treating patients with AUDs.},

As our  current knowledge is mainly derived from high-income countries such in Europe and  North-America, it is difficult to address the wider socio-cultural, psychosocial  context, and genetic factors in which risk and resilience are embedded in low-  and medium-income countries. c-VEDA was established as the first and largest  India-based multi-site cohort investigating the vulnerabilities for the  development of externalizing disorders, addictions, and other mental health  problems. Using a harmonised data collection plan coordinated with multiple  cohorts in China, USA, and Europe, baseline data were collected from seven study  sites between November 2016 and May 2019. Nine thousand and ten participants  between the ages of 6 and 23 were assessed during this time, amongst which 1278  participants underwent more intensive assessments including MRI scans. Both waves  of follow-ups have started according to the accelerated cohort structure with  planned missingness design. Here, we present descriptive statistics on several  key domains of assessments, and the full baseline dataset will be made accessible  for researchers outside the consortium in September 2019.

The Consortium on Vulnerability to Externalizing Disorders and Addictions  (cVEDA), based in India, aims to examine environmental influences on genomic  variations, neurodevelopmental trajectories and vulnerability to psychopathology,  with a focus on externalizing disorders. METHODS: cVEDA is a longitudinal cohort  study, with planned missingness design for yearly follow-up. Participants have  been recruited from multi-site tertiary care mental health settings, local  communities, schools and colleges. 10,000 individuals between 6 and 23 years of  age, of all genders, representing five geographically, ethnically, and  socio-culturally distinct regions in India, and exposures to variations in early  life adversity (psychosocial, nutritional, toxic exposures, slum-habitats,  socio-political conflicts, urban/rural living, mental illness in the family) have  been assessed using age-appropriate instruments to capture socio-demographic  information, temperament, environmental exposures, parenting, psychiatric  morbidity, and neuropsychological functioning. Blood/saliva and urine samples  have been collected for genetic, epigenetic and toxicological (heavy metals,  volatile organic compounds) studies. Structural (T1, T2, DTI) and functional  (resting state fMRI) MRI brain scans have been performed on approximately 15\% of  the individuals. All data and biological samples are maintained in a databank and  biobank, respectively. DISCUSSION: The cVEDA has established the largest  neurodevelopmental database in India, comparable to global datasets, with  detailed environmental characterization. This should permit identification of  environmental and genetic vulnerabilities to psychopathology within a  developmental framework. Neuroimaging and neuropsychological data from this study  are already yielding insights on brain growth and maturation patterns.},

However, there is a dearth of literature exploring alterations of cortical  thickness (CTh) in this population. T1-weighted structural brain MRI was acquired  in 75 substance-naïve male offspring of treatment-seeking early onset ({\textless}25 years)  AUD patients with high familial loading of AUDs (≥2 affected relatives) (FHP) and  65 age-matched substance-naïve male controls with negative family history from  the community. Surface-based CTh reconstruction was done using FreeSurfer.  Univariate general linear models were implemented at each vertex using SurfStat,  controlling for age (linear and quadratic effects), and head size, to examine the  main effect of familial AUD risk on CTh and its relationship with externalizing  symptom score (ESS). A Johnson-Neyman procedure revealed that the main effect of  familial AUD risk on CTh was seen during adolescence, where the FHP group had  thicker cortices involving bilateral precentral gyri, left caudal middle frontal  gyrus (MFG), bilateral temporo-parietal junction, left inferior-frontal gyrus and  right inferior-temporal gyrus. Thicker cortices in left MFG and inferior-parietal  lobule were also associated with greater ESS within both groups. More  importantly, these group differences diminished with age by young adulthood.  Familial AUD risk is associated with age-related differences in maturation of  several higher order association cortices that are critical to ongoing  development in executive function, emotion regulation and social cognition during  adolescence. Early supportive intervention for a delay in alcohol initiation  during this critical phase may be crucial for this at-risk population.},

The present study aimed at  investigating the impact of baclofen treatment on cue-induced brain activation  pattern and its relationship with relapse outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-three  inpatients with AUD underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging  cue-reactivity task before beginning medication with baclofen and 2 weeks later.  Twelve additional inpatients with AUD, who did not receive any anticraving  medications, formed the control group. All subjects were prospectively followed  up for 90 days post-discharge or until lapse to first alcohol use. RESULTS:  Whole-brain linear mixed effects analysis revealed a significant group-by-time  interaction with greater activation of the bilateral dorsolateral pre-frontal  cortex and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following baclofen treatment in  comparison with the control group. Further, cox regression analysis revealed that  increased activation of ACC and deactivation of insular cortex (IC) was  associated with longer time to first alcohol use only in the baclofen treatment  group but not in the control group. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary  evidence for the neural predictors of baclofen treatment response in AUD.  Baclofen treatment in AUD was associated with changes in cue-reactivity at  critical brain regions within the incentive-salience network. Importantly,  baclofen treatment-related specific activation of regions involved in cognitive  control (ACC) and deactivation of regions involved in reward anticipation (IC)  prolonged the time to first alcohol drink.},

The present study aimed at comparing resting brain functional  connectivity and their association with externalizing symptoms and alcoholism  familial density in 40 substance-naive high-risk (HR) male offspring from  high-density AUD families and 30 matched healthy low-risk (LR) males without a  family history of substance dependence using graph theory-based network analysis.  The HR subjects from high-density AUD families compared with LR, showed  significantly reduced clustering, small-worldness, and local network efficiency.  The frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, sensorimotor and cerebellar networks  exhibited significantly reduced functional segregation. These disruptions  exhibited independent incremental value in predicting the externalizing symptoms  over and above the demographic variables. The reduction of functional segregation  in HR subjects was significant across both the younger and older age groups and  was proportional to the family loading of AUDs. Detection and estimation of these  developmentally relevant disruptions in small-world architecture at critical  brain regions sub-serving cognitive, affective, and sensorimotor processes are  vital for understanding the familial risk for early onset alcoholism as well as  for understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of externalizing behaviors.},

The lack of proper recommendations  regarding the dosage has important implications for safety in clinical  management. In this context, we report two patients who were started with  Baclofen as an anti-craving agent, and later developed serious complications  following acute self inflicted overdose. We also highlight the important  mechanisms of such complications and precautions that needs to be exerted while  prescribing.},

  abstract = {Considerable variation has been observed in the course and outcome of schizophrenia. With regard to epidemiology of schizophrenia, papers from  different Asian countries have reported findings which are in contrast with  literature from the western countries. In this background we undertook a  narrative review of literature regarding course and outcome of schizophrenia in  Asian countries. We conducted Medline search for English-language papers on  long-term course and outcome of schizophrenia conducted in Asia in the past 3  decades. We also reviewed data pertaining to Asian countries from the World  Health Organization's International Study of Schizophrenia (ISoS). In addition to  ISoS, we retrieved 14 reports from 9 Asian countries. While ISoS used comparable  methodology across the countries, non-ISoS studies differed substantially in  their aims, sampling, follow-up rates and assessment tools used for studying the  course and outcome. Overall, the percentage of patients who experienced clinical  and functional outcome in the Asian countries were largely comparable to those in  the western studies. We observed significant variations in the long-term outcome  and mortality in schizophrenia even among the Asian countries. In conclusion,  there is substantial variation in the long-term course and outcome and mortality  across different Asian countries. The reason for this remains unexplored.  Cross-national studies exploring biological and cultural explanations for this  variation may provide clues, which may have heuristic, translational and  public-health significance.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Craving induction in a controlled environment is helpful in the research of craving mechanism and its role in development of alcohol dependence  (AD). We describe a novel tool Visual Image-induced Craving for Ethanol (VICE)  and its effects on brain activation with pilot functional magnetic resonance  imaging (fMRI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alcohol-related visual cues (ARCs) in 5  scenarios were photographed, which included pictures of bars, alcoholic beverage  bottles, pouring of alcohol into glasses, glasses filled with alcohol, and scenes  of people sipping alcohol, counterbalanced with neutral pictures (involving  water, milk etc.,). Craving scores were obtained from 15 hospitalized patients  with AD to validate this tool. In the pilot fMRI (3-Tesla) study, 5 patients were  examined using VICE in a symptom provocation model. Group level-fixed effect  analysis of brain activation differences was done using SPM8. RESULTS: VICE  showed a high internal consistency with Cronbach's α coefficient of 0.86, which  confirmed its reliability. Concurrent validity of VICE was demonstrated via its  convergence with the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale. ARCs had significantly greater  mean craving scores than neutral cues in all the 5 scenarios (intentional  validity). In the pilot fMRI, patients were found to have greater activation  while viewing ARCs compared to the neutral cues in right insular cortex and  deficient activation in right orbitofrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The VICE is a  reliable and valid measure of alcohol craving with promising clinical and  translational research implications. Preliminary fMRI findings indicate it can be  used as a symptom provocation tool for fMRI experiments.},

  abstract = {AIM: The study explored the socio-demographic, clinical and legal profile of forensic psychiatric inpatients in an attempt to improve the existing mental  health services for prisoners within the prison and in psychiatric hospitals.  METHOD: ology: A chart review of 135 forensic psychiatric inpatients admitted  between January 2005 and December 2009 was done. A structured data-extraction  tool was used for data collection and a descriptive approach for analyses.  RESULTS: Subjects were referred either directly from prison (62.2\%) or from court  (37.8\%) for diagnosis, treatment or certification. References to the Mental  Health Act 1987, charges and inclusion of first investigation report and  behavioural observation report was lacking in most. The majority of prisoners  (85.7\%) were under trial, murder being the most common charge. Psychiatric  diagnosis was made in 90.3\%, the most common being psychosis. Substance use  (nicotine, alcohol, cannabis) and high-risk behaviours were also common.  CONCLUSION: There is a need to streamline the procedure of referral and to  sensitize the referral authorities about the Mental Health Act and mental  illnesses, and the need to enclose first investigation reports and behavioural  observation reports. De-addiction services and facilities need to be established  within prison premises so that the inmates get the benefit of treatment at the  earliest opportunity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Telemedicine Network Project in the state of Karnataka was introduced in the year 2001. This is a value added service from the health  department of the government of Karnataka. There is no data on its utilization  pattern or its future challenges. This study was conducted from a nodal center in  order to understand the above two issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a  51-item survey questionnaire that captured data on infrastructure, technical  aspects, and connectivity parameters, tele-consultations including emergency  services, human resources, and coordination aspects both at the client as well as  the nodal centers. RESULTS: Services are operational in 25 district hospitals  across the state for the past 3.3 (2.1) years. Space was ear-marked across all  the client centers. Back-up power supply was present only in 10 (40\%) of the  client centers. Quality of satellite connection was acceptable in 18 (72\%)  centers. Approximately, 3.0 (1.8) phone calls had to be made to the nodal centers  to obtain one appointment. Monthly maximum and minimum cases done over the past 2  year period were reported as 58.2 (66.2) and 13.5 (16.2) respectively. Each  consultation lasted for 26.1 (13.9) min. Tele-consultation advices from nodal  centers were carried out completely in only 9 (36\%) centers. Only in 13 (52\%)  client centers, did doctors keep up with appointment regularly. All technicians  reported that the training they received was inadequate. 16 (64\%) technicians  were asked to do works that were not pertaining to telemedicine. 19 (76\%)  technicians had frequently felt insecurities about their jobs. CONCLUSIONS: The  telemedicine service has been largely under-utilized and has failed to deliver  the promise in Karnataka state. At present, the obstacles reflect both inherent  limitations in the technology and also improper use of human resources.  Successful implementation of the given recommendations may in the long run help  optimal utilization and reach all end-users.},
